The Musée d'Orsay is located in an old train station that was inaugurated in 1900 on the occasion of the World Exhibition in Paris. The station had a high traffic of trains until 1939.

Since the end of the Second World War the station was left in neglect and in 1960 it was planned to demolish it.

It was in 1977 when the station got rid of its fatal fate thanks to the transformation of the building into a museum, which was inaugurated in 1986.
